# Random Message Generator
## Introduction
This is a Code Academy training project, where I had to create a javascript that would randomly print out a message as output.
The message consists of a motivational qoute, a lucky colour and what cuisine the user can try for the day.

## Technologies

* JavaScript
* Node.js

## Launch
To run the project on your terminal Node.js has to be installed.
To run the project just type node and then randomMessages.js in terminal.
You should see HI as output in ASCII, followed by a message.
